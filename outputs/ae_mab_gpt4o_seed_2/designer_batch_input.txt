Propose a new MAB-based adaptive restart policy algorithm for the Kissat-AE-MAB (AE_kissat2025_MAB) SAT solver.\n\nA SAT solver's restart policy controls when the solver abandons its current search path and begins a fresh search. In Kissat-AE-MAB, the solver implements a MAB-based adaptive restart/reset mechanism at runtime. This runtime logic forms part of the broader AE (Automated Evolution) framework, which evolves solver heuristics, parameters, and variants across many runs.\n\nYour policy should define how to choose heuristics over time, how to compute rewards, and when to trigger restarts/resets under each heuristic. You should start by thinking what defines a good MAB-based restart policy and how to make a good restart policy.\n\n### Task  \nDesign a MAB-aware restart/reset policy (conceptual, not code) to maximize solver performance (solved instances, PAR-2). Your policy must:\n\n- Define restart triggers/scores that work with the MAB framework.\n- Specify how the policy interacts with MAB arm selection.\n- Provide quantitative rules and tie-breakers.\n- Run in O(1) or O(log n) per conflict.\n- Include a brief rationale for why your adaptive MAB-based policy should improve solver performance on a diverse set of SAT instances.\n\n### Available Internal Attributes\n \n**Base Kissat Attributes:**  \n  - is stable stage - source: solver->stable  \n  - level - source: solver->level  \n  - number of conflicts - source: solver->statistics.conflicts  \n  - number of decisions - source: solver->statistics.decisions  \n  - limit of conflicts - source: solver->limits.restart.conflicts  \n  - glue-moving averages - AVERAGE(fast_glue), AVERAGE(slow_glue)\n  - decision rate moving average - source: solver->averages[solver->stable].decision_rate.value\n\n**MAB-Specific Attributes:**  \n  - MAB enabled flag - source: solver->mab  \n  - current heuristic - source: solver->heuristic\n  - cumulative reward for arm i - source: solver->mab_reward[i]\n  - number of times arm i was selected - source: solver->mab_select[i]\n  - total number of arms - source: solver->mab_heuristics  \n  - MAB decisions counter - source: solver->mab_decisions \n  - MAB conflicts counter - source: solver->mab_conflicts\n  - total variable-choice count since last selection - source: solver->mab_chosen_tot\n\n### Output Format (JSON only)  \n1. \"Algorithm Name\" — concise title of the MAB-based policy  \n2. \"Algorithm\" — structured description of the MAB-aware restart/reset policy, specifying arms, selection policy, reward function, restart/reset triggers, bookkeeping updates, and parameters.\n3. \"Reason\" — argue why this is a good restart policy, keet this short\n\n### Constraints  \n- Use only the listed signals.  \n- The policy logic should run in O(1) or O(log n) per conflict/decision.\n- Consider MAB exploration/exploitation trade-offs\n- Keep explanations formal, concise, algorithmic.\n\n### Final Instruction  \nAct as a SAT-solver algorithm designer. Produce a single, self-contained restart policy description implementable inside Kissat-AE-MAB's restart logic.\n"}], "temperature": 0.7}}

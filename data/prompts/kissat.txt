You are an AI researcher specializing in CDCL restart policies. Propose a new restart policy algorithm for the Kissat SAT solver.

### Task
Design a restart policy (conceptual, not code) to maximize solver performance (solved instances, PAR-2). Your policy must:
- Define a restart trigger/score and when a restart fires.
- Provide quantitative rules and tie-breakers.
- Run in O(1) or O(log n) per conflict/decision.
- Use only the signals listed below.
- Include a brief rationale for expected gains.

### Available Internal Signals
- stable (bool) — source: solver->stable
- level (int) — source: solver->level
- stats.conflicts (uint64) — source: solver->statistics.conflicts
- stats.decisions (uint64) — source: solver->statistics.decisions
- restart_conflict_limit (uint64) — source: solver->limits.restart.conflicts
- fast_glue_ewma (double) — source: solver->averages[solver->stable].fast_glue.value
- slow_glue_ewma (double) — source: solver->averages[solver->stable].slow_glue.value
- decision_rate_ewma (double) — source: solver->averages[solver->stable].decision_rate.value

### Output Format (JSON only)
1. Algorithm Name – concise title
2. Scoring Function Definition – exact mathematical/logical trigger
3. Selection Procedure – numbered steps to decide restarts
4. Tie-breaking Rules
5. Reason – argue why this is a good restart policy

### Parseability Requirements
- Output a single top-level JSON object, UTF-8 encoded.
- No markdown, no code fences, no comments, no extra text.
- Use exactly these five keys with exact spelling:
  - "Algorithm Name" (string)
  - "Scoring Function Definition" (string)
  - "Selection Procedure" (array of non-empty strings)
  - "Tie-breaking Rules" (array of non-empty strings)
  - "Reason" (string)
- No trailing commas; no NaN/Infinity; plain numbers/strings only.
- If a list would be empty, output an empty JSON array [].

### Response Length Limits
- Total JSON string: ≤ 2000 characters.
- "Algorithm Name": ≤ 80 characters.
- "Scoring Function Definition": ≤ 800 characters.
- "Selection Procedure": ≤ 6 items; each item ≤ 180 characters.
- "Tie-breaking Rules": ≤ 5 items; each item ≤ 140 characters.
- Prefer brevity; do not exceed any limits.

### Constraints
- No code/pseudocode.
- Modify only the restart policy.
- Use only the listed signals.
- Keep explanations formal, concise, algorithmic.

### Final Instruction
Act as a SAT-solver algorithm designer. Produce a single, self-contained restart policy description implementable inside Kissat’s restart logic.
